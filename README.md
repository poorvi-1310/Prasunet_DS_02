# Exploratory Data Analysis on the Titanic Dataset

## Overview

This project involves performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic dataset. The goal is to analyze the data, uncover patterns, and gain insights about the factors that affected the survival of passengers.

## Dataset

The dataset is taken from kaggle. It consists of 12 columns.  It includes information about the passengers, such as:

- PassengerId: Unique ID for each passenger
- Survived: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
- Name: Passenger name
- Sex: Gender
- Age: Age in years
- SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic
- Parch: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic
- Ticket: Ticket number
- Fare: Passenger fare
- Cabin: Cabin number
- Embarked: Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the Titanic dataset file
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks used for the EDA.
- `images/`: Images and plots generated during the analysis.
- `README.md`: Project overview and documentation (this file).

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Load the dataset and handle missing values.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Analyze the data to understand distributions, relationships, and patterns.
    - Univariate Analysis: Distribution of individual variables.
    - Bivariate Analysis: Relationships between two variables.
    - Multivariate Analysis: Relationships among multiple variables.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features based on the existing data.
4. **Visualization**: Use plots to visualize data and findings.
5. **Conclusions**: Summarize the key findings from the analysis.
